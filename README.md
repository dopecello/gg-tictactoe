# Tic-Tac-Toe for Games Global

Welcome to my tic-tac-toe game!

If you want to try the live version of this game, you can check it out by [clicking this link](https://gg-tictactoe.netlify.app/)

## Local Machine Setup

- First, clone the repository into a directory of choice
- Open a terminal, and simply install the dependencies by running `npm i` at the root of the project directory.
- After the dependencies are installed, in the same terminal, run `npm run dev`

That is it! You are now able to make edits to the game with hot-reloading and can easily change the styles to your liking by editing the tailwind utlity classes within the JSX or HTML.

## Notes

If you are new to tailwind or don't want to constantly refer to the docs and if you are using VSCode, I recommend installing the [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) extension. It is a very workflow-friendly tool that will assist in your styling with Tailwind.
